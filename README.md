# OBWizardFun

Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin for our wizard themed lobby whereby imaginary wizards cast random spells on unsuspecting players.

No commands. Just put it into the plugins folder and enjoy.

Spells can be cast on a specific randomly chosen player or all players.<br>
Players can also cast spells on themselves or others using the /cast command!

FIRE - Sets you on fire<br>
FIREWORK - Launches a firework under you<br>
EXPLOSION - Explodes you and throws you up in the air<br>
LIGHTNING - Lightning strike<br>
SOAK - Ice bucket challeng<br>
WEIRD - Some random particles around player<br>
FROST - Oh so cold!<br>
PEE - Well ah ehm!<br>
GEYSER - Steam jet under you<br>
FIREBALL - Launches fireball at you<br>
SOUND EFFECT Plays a random effect from all Minecraft sounds<br>
EVIL WITCH - Sends an evil witch to destroy you<br>
ANGRY BEES - A swarm of angry bees attacks you!<br>
RABID WOLVES - A pack of very angry wolves hunt you!<br>
WRATHWARDEN - Not one, but FOUR Wardens are on to you!<br>
BATTYBATS - So annoying!<br>
DANCING ENTITY - Mischievous little devils!<br>

Omit any spaces in the spell name to cast with the /cast <spell> <player> command.<br>
So, /cast RABIDWOLVES bob_builder - will cast the Rabid Wolves spell on bob.

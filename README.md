Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin for our wizard themed lobby whereby imaginary wizards cast random spells on unsuspecting players.

No commands. Just put it into the plugins folder and enjoy.

Currently uses default minecraft events and effects such as lightning, fire, explosion, fireball, and setting off a random firework at the players location. There are some custom particle effects being worked on also. Two are in the plugin presently which drench a player with water and another to puddle yellow water around the players feet - I will let your imagination do the rest :-)

Compiled for 1.18, and compiled with Java 17, but only uses bukkit/spigot API, so should be fine with older versions (up to a point).
